SYLLABUS = "Parallelizing Compilers - motivation and overview, structure of a parallelizing compiler; review of code optimization techniques in compilers for sequential machines. Parallelism detection - data dependence, direction vectors, loop carried and loop independent dependences; tests for data dependence and their applicability, construction of data dependence graph. Control dependence and control dependence graph. Restructuring transformations and automatic extraction of parallelism; representation of iteration spaces of multiply nested loops; loop based transformations such as loop distribution, loop coalescing, loop inter-change and cycle shrinking transformation. Introduction to machine models and associated algorithms for parallel code generation and task graph construction. Interprocedural analysis - aliasing information, summary data flow analysis, interprocedural constant propagation, interprocedural data dependence analysis and parallelisation of call statements. Partitioning and Scheduling of a task graph; models for communication, partitioning and scheduling algorithms, dynamic scheduling algorithms, target code generation. Case studies of contemporary parallelising compiler efforts."
