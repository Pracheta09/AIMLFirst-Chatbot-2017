PROFESSOR = "Shubhada Deshmukh"
CREDITS = "3"
SYLLABUS = "1. Describe various automata theoretic models for recognizing formal languages.
2. Comprehend general purpose powers and computability issues related to state
machines and grammars.
Discriminate the expressive powers of various automata theoretic and formal
language theoretic models and illustrate significance of non determinism for
automata theoretic models.
4. Explain the relevance of Church-Turing thesis, and comprehend the
theoretical limit of computation (independent of software or hardware used)
via the concept of undecidability.
5. To infer the applicability of various automata theoretic models for recognizing
formal languages
6. Select appropriate computing theory principles, models for the solution of
complex computing problems."
